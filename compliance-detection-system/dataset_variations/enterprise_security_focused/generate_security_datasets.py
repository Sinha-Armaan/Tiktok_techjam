## Executive Summary

{feature_name} is a mission-critical security component designed to protect enterprise assets against advanced persistent threats (APTs) and sophisticated cyber attacks. This system implements defense-in-depth strategies aligned with NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0 and Zero Trust Architecture principles.

## Security Objectives

### Primary Security Goals
- Achieve 99.9% threat detection accuracy with <0.1% false positive rate
- Implement real-time threat response with <30 second MTTR
- Maintain SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 compliance
- Support forensic investigation and incident response capabilities

### Security Success Metrics
