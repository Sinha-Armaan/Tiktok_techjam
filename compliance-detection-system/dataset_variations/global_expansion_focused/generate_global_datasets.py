Global Expansion Focused Dataset Generator

This variation emphasizes international expansion and compliance:
- Multi-region data sovereignty compliance
- Localization and internationalization features
- Cross-border data transfer regulations
- Regional privacy law compliance (GDPR, LGPD, PIPEDA, etc.)
- Cultural adaptation and local market requirements
