user_registration,False,"Based on the provided evidence, the 'user_registration' feature does not require geo-specific compliance logic. The static analysis found no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals. The rules engine also indicates that no geo logic is required, with a confidence score of 0.00 and no matched rules or missing controls.",,0.0,,,static analysis; rules engine results,,No runtime observations available.,False,low,2025-08-30T14:41:22.007136
content_recommendation,False,"The Rules Engine Results indicate that the feature does not require geo-specific logic (Requires Geo Logic: False). The Confidence Score is 0.00, and no rules were matched. The static analysis evidence shows no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals. While parental controls are present, this alone does not necessitate geo-specific compliance logic based on the provided evidence.",,0.1,,,STATIC ANALYSIS EVIDENCE; RULES ENGINE RESULTS,,No runtime observations were provided.,False,low,2025-08-30T14:41:23.761113
crisis_intervention,False,"The Rules Engine Results indicate that the 'crisis_intervention' feature does not require geo-specific logic (Requires Geo Logic: False). The confidence score is 0.00, and no matched rules or missing controls are listed. The static analysis evidence shows no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals.

ambiguous_filter_feature,False,"The Rules Engine Results indicate that the feature does not require geo-specific logic (Requires Geo Logic: False). This is supported by the static analysis evidence, which found no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals. Additionally, there are no reporting clients, recommendation systems, or parental controls associated with the feature. Therefore, based on the provided evidence, there is no indication that the feature requires geo-specific compliance logic.",,0.95,,,Static Analysis Evidence; Rules Engine Results,,No runtime observations provided.,False,low,2025-08-30T14:41:27.209441
regional_content_block,True,"The feature `regional_content_block` exhibits several indicators suggesting the necessity of geo-specific compliance logic. First, the presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:12` indicates that the feature behaves differently based on the user's country, specifically 'US', 'EU', 'CA', and 'FL'. Second, the use of the `age_restrictions` library in `regional_content_manager.py:35` suggests age verification is implemented, which often varies by jurisdiction. Third, the data residency signal in `regional_content_manager.py:125` indicates that data is handled differently based on the user's region (EU). Finally, the feature has parental controls enabled, which are often subject to geo-specific regulations.",GDPR; CCPA; COPPA; PIPEDA,0.9,,,Geographic Branching Signals; Age Verification Signals; Data Residency Signals; Parental Controls,regional_content_manager.py:12; regional_content_manager.py:35; regional_content_manager.py:125,"The feature likely blocks or modifies content based on the user's geographic location, age, and data residency requirements.",False,high,2025-08-30T14:41:29.802269
age_gated_messaging,True,"The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:45` indicates that the feature has different logic based on the user's country (CA, FL, EU, US). Additionally, the use of the `parental_consent` library in `regional_content_manager.py:67` suggests age verification is being performed, which often varies by jurisdiction. Therefore, the feature likely requires geo-specific compliance logic.",COPPA; GDPR; CCPA,0.8,,,Geographic Branching Signals; Age Verification Signals,regional_content_manager.py:45; regional_content_manager.py:67,The feature's behavior will vary based on the user's geographic location and age.,False,medium,2025-08-30T14:41:31.749456
cross_border_data_sharing,True,"The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:78` indicating different countries (EU, CA, IN, AU) and data residency signals in `regional_content_manager.py:85` specifying the EU region strongly suggests the need for geo-specific compliance logic. While the Rules Engine initially indicates `Requires Geo Logic: False`, the static analysis evidence overrides this, as the code explicitly handles different regions and data residency requirements.",GDPR; CCPA; PIPEDA; Australian Privacy Principles,0.9,,,Geographic Branching Signals; Data Residency Signals,regional_content_manager.py:78; regional_content_manager.py:85,"The feature likely adapts its behavior based on the user's geographic location, potentially impacting data handling, content display, and user consent requirements.",False,high,2025-08-30T14:41:33.984221
regional_advertising_controls,True,"The feature `regional_advertising_controls` requires geo-specific logic. The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:95` indicates that the feature behaves differently based on the user's country (CA, US, EU, AU). Additionally, the rule engine results indicate that the feature requires geo logic due to the `NCMEC_REPORTING` rule. This rule is related to the NCMEC Mandatory Reporting Requirements, which are triggered by the presence of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The parental controls and age verification signals in `regional_content_manager.py:103` further support the need for geo-specific compliance logic, as age of consent and child protection laws vary by region.",NCMEC Mandatory Reporting Requirements,0.75,NCMEC_REPORTING,ncmec_report_pipeline; content_moderation,Geographic Branching Signals; Age Verification Signals; NCMEC_REPORTING,regional_content_manager.py:95; regional_content_manager.py:103,"The feature likely adjusts advertising content and user experience based on the user's geographic location, potentially to comply with regional advertising regulations and age-related restrictions.

content_recommendation_geo_filter,True,"The feature `content_recommendation_geo_filter` requires geo-specific logic. The static analysis evidence shows geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:112` for countries 'US', 'EU', 'IN', and 'AU'. The rules engine results indicate that the feature requires geo logic due to the 'NCMEC_REPORTING' rule. The 'NCMEC Mandatory Reporting Requirements' regulation necessitates reporting of CSAM, which may have geo-specific implications regarding reporting procedures and legal definitions of CSAM.",NCMEC Mandatory Reporting Requirements,0.75,NCMEC_REPORTING,ncmec_report_pipeline; content_moderation,Geographic Branching Signals; Recommendation System; Rules Engine Results; NCMEC Mandatory Reporting Requirements,regional_content_manager.py:112,No runtime observations provided.,False,medium,2025-08-30T14:41:39.056344
