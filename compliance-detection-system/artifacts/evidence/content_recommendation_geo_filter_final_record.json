  "reasoning": "The feature requires geo-specific logic because the Rules Engine flagged the 'NCMEC_REPORTING' rule as matching, indicating a need to comply with mandatory reporting requirements related to child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The static analysis also found geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:112` for countries including the US, EU, IN, and AU, suggesting that content recommendations are already being handled differently based on location. While the geographic branching itself might be business-driven, the NCMEC reporting requirement necessitates geo-specific logic to ensure compliance with mandatory reporting laws.",
