  "reasoning": "The feature `regional_advertising_controls` requires geo-specific logic. The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:95` indicates that the feature behaves differently based on the user's country (CA, US, EU, AU). Additionally, the rules engine flagged the need for NCMEC reporting, which is a mandatory reporting obligation with potential geographic variations in implementation and enforcement. The age verification signal in `regional_content_manager.py:103` further supports the need for geo-specific logic, as age of majority and related regulations vary by region.",
