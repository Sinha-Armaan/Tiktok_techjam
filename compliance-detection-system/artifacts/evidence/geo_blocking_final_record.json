  "reasoning": "The Rules Engine Results indicate that the feature does not require geo-specific logic (Requires Geo Logic: False). The confidence score is 0.00, suggesting low confidence in this determination. The static analysis evidence shows no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals. While the feature involves parental controls, the evidence does not indicate any geo-specific requirements for these controls. Therefore, based solely on the provided evidence, the feature does not require geo-specific logic.",
