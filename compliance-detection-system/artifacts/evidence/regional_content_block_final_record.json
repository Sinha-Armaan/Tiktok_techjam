  "requires_geo_logic": true,
  "reasoning": "The feature `regional_content_block` exhibits several indicators that necessitate geo-specific compliance logic. The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:12` indicates content variations based on countries like 'US', 'EU', 'CA', and 'FL'. The data residency signal in `regional_content_manager.py:125` specifying 'EU' further strengthens the need for geo-specific logic. The age verification signal in `regional_content_manager.py:35` using the `age_restrictions` library also suggests compliance with varying age-related regulations across different regions. The presence of parental controls further reinforces the need for geo-specific compliance logic, as parental consent and control requirements vary significantly across jurisdictions.",
