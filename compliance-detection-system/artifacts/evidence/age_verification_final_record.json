  "reasoning": "Based on the provided evidence, the feature `age_verification` does not require geo-specific compliance logic. The Rules Engine Results indicate `Requires Geo Logic: False` with a confidence score of 0.00. The static analysis found no geographic branching signals, age verification signals, or data residency signals. While the feature has parental controls enabled, this alone does not necessitate geo-specific logic based on the provided evidence.",
