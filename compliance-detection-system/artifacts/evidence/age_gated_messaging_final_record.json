  "reasoning": "The feature `age_gated_messaging` requires geo-specific compliance logic. The presence of geographic branching signals in `regional_content_manager.py:45` indicates that the application logic varies based on the user's country (CA, FL, EU, US). Additionally, the use of the `parental_consent` library at `regional_content_manager.py:67` suggests that age verification and parental consent mechanisms are in place, which are often subject to geo-specific regulations like GDPR-K and COPPA. The combination of geographic branching and age verification strongly suggests the need for geo-specific compliance logic.",
